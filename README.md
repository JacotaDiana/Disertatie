# Traffic Light Simulator

**The Map** will contain the following elements:
- Entrances: this element will generate cars with a given frequency;
- Traffic Light: the entity which will allow or stop the car to pass through the intersection;
- Exit: the final destination of the car. This is randomly generated when the car is created;
- Road: the segment which connects the other elements of the system.
